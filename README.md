# The Simon Game
https://shaharshw.github.io/The-Simon-Game/

This project is a digital implementation of the classic memory game called "Simon Game." It tests your memory and pattern recognition skills by challenging you to repeat a sequence of randomly generated colors and sounds.

# Game Description

"The Simon Game" is a memory-based game where players must repeat a sequence of colors and sounds. The game starts with a single random color/sound, and the player must reproduce the sequence correctly. After each successful round, the game adds one more color/sound to the sequence, making it progressively more challenging.

The game continues until the player makes a mistake by failing to repeat the correct sequence. At that point, the game ends, and the player's score is displayed.

# Usage

Press any key to begin the game.
Observe the sequence of colors and sounds played by the game.
Use your mouse to repeat the sequence by clicking on the corresponding buttons.
If you make a mistake, the game will end, and your final score will be displayed.
Press any key again to play a new game.
